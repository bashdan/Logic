Logic Project (Prolog-like interpreter)

The project was a final project for the capstone course of the University of Iowa's Computer Science program. It is a relatively simple Prolog-like interpreter which understands most basic resolution and unification principles. It does not support the cut operator, and by default yields feedback for any provided input. Its basic function works well, but I did not include the testcases that it had to pass.
